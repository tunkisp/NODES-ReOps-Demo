It begins with a handful of queries before transitioning to neodash, and after returning to this notebook, we build the Recommendation System.\n",

    "One of the great things about neo4j's python API is that it automatically returns any (tabular) results from a query as a pandas dataframe! This is a great time-saver--if we imagine ahead to integration and deployment, it would be very easy to rig up a responsive API between your front-end and the graph database to query the graph, return results as a dataframe, easily convert that to json, and send it to the front-end. Alternatively, if you need to integrate the graph with extant relational data on which your applications rely, graph query results could be pushed straight into a view from dataframe, rows and columns and all!"

    "### Building the Recommendation System\n",
    "Building a recommendation system using neo4j essentially consists of two steps:\n",
    "1. Project specific node(s) and relationship(s) subject to any analytics to an in-memory 'sub-graph'\n",
    "2. Run algorithm on in-memory graph, then generate new nodes/relationships/properties\n",
    "  - Write them back to your 'main' graph, or\n",
    "  - Write them to your projection and rinse/repeat step two\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there may be some pre-requisites, depending on *what* you are doing to *which* node(s) and/or relationship(s). In order to build the Recommendation System for the ReOps Toolbox, we need to run the K-NN algorithm over respondent nodes. However, there are a handful of limitations with how those properties may be expressed (data types!) in neo4j with graph projections. For that, we cannot use strings as they are; we need integers, floats, or *lists of integers/floats*. The latter, of course, imply some form of descriptive vector--since our variables of interest are all strings, we can one-hot encode these and create new properties in-graph on the respondent nodes. K-NN will then take all OHE properties together and calculate Jaccard distances between node-pairs, returning the top-10 most similar respondents for each individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why not bring in the nodes rather than re-specifying them as properties on the Respondent?\n",
    "This is in part another limitation of graph projections (many algorithms don't work with more than two node labels or relationships, many only work with one of either/each). However, it's also a product of what we are trying to do: we want explicit respondent-to-respondent relationships to be created if there is sufficient similarity between the two, and we need to pack all the info about respondents into a \"small package\" for our projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do two things for each demographic element:\n",
    "1. Create a one-hot encoding for each element\n",
    "2. Write back the string element (or list, if more than one) \n",
    "\n",
    "I do the second bit mainly for the purpose of simplifying some demo queries."
